/**
The player class is concerned with describing a player and things that relate to it. It keeps track of the name of a player, the order of the player in relation to other players in the game, and the move the player may want to make (which is just as simple as the user picking which column of the board they want their token to be dropped in). This class could also have logic to create only valid users. E.g. the playerNumber should not be greater than 4 based on the specification we've received.
